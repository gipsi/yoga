<h2>Adho Mukha Svanasana</h2>
<p>
<b>Downward Facing Dog</b> is an <i>inverted v posture</i> with both palms and feet on the ground. Builds strength in the upper body and increases flexibility.
</p>
<details><summary>Variations</summary>
    Downward Dog is a restorative pose for experienced practitioners, but can be hard work for beginners. The pose can be varied by bending the knees, allowing the heels to lift slightly; by supporting the heels, such as with a rolled-up yoga mat; by lowering one forearm to the floor, extending the other hand forward; and by combinations of these.

Other variations include bending one knee and lowering the hip on that side; alternately "pedalling" by bending one knee and raising the ankle on that side, then the other, and then hooking each foot in turn behind the other ankle; raising one leg, either stretching it straight out, or bending the knee, and flexing and extending the foot; alternating between bending both knees and straightening the legs while bringing the shoulders forward directly above the hands; and twisting the body, reaching back with one hand to grasp the opposite ankle.</details>

Ananda Balasana or "Happy Baby Pose" is an inverted form of Child's Pose; it has the body on the back, the thighs alongside the body, the knees bent and the hands grasping the toes.[10]

Uttana Shishosana or "Extended Puppy Pose" stretches forwards from all fours until the forearms and forehead are resting on the floor and the thighs are vertical, giving a pose intermediate between Balasana and Adho Mukha Shvanasana (Downward Dog Pose).[11]

Shasangasana (‡§∂‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§∏‡§®‡§æ) or "Rabbit Pose", practised in Bikram Yoga, has the tailbone lifted until the thighs are vertical and the head and arms pointing back towards the feet, creating an intense flexion of the spine.

<details><summary>Variations</summary>
Kapalabhati (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§≠‡§æ‡§§‡§ø, romanized: kapƒÅlabhƒÅti), also called breath of fire,[1] is an important Shatkarma, a purification in hatha yoga. The word kapalabhati is made up of two Sanskrit words: kapƒÅla meaning 'skull', and bhƒÅti meaning 'shining, illuminating'. It is intended mainly for cleaning the sinuses but according to the Gheranda Samhita has magical curative effects.[2] The Technique of Kapalabhati[3] involves short and strong forceful exhalations and inhalation happens automatically.[4] There are three forms of Kapalabhati:

Vatakrama kapalabhati, a practice similar to the Pranayama technique of Bhastrika, except that exhalation is active while inhalation is passive, the opposite of normal breathing.
Vyutkrama kapalabhati, a practice similar to Jala neti, it involves sniffing water through the nostrils and letting it flow down into the mouth, and then spitting it out.
Sheetkrama kapalabhati, can be considered the reverse of Vyutkrama kapalabhati, in which water is taken through the mouth and expelled through the nose.
